# Git branch names

Here are some guidelines for naming Git branches: 

- Use separators: Use hyphens (-) to separate words in a branch name. For example, `feature/new-thing` or `bugfix/fpms-crash`.
- Be lowercase: Keep branch names lowercase. 
- Avoid special characters: Avoid spaces, underscores, punctuation, or any non-alphanumeric characters.
- Start with a category word: Start the branch name with a word that indicates the branch's purpose. 
- Keep it concise: While there's no strict limit on branch name length, it's best to keep them short and manageable. 
- Be descriptive: The name should reflect the work done on the branch. 
- Avoid reserved names: Don't use reserved names like HEAD, FETCH_HEAD, or ORIG_HEAD. 
- Avoid generic names: Don't use generic names like "temp" for a branch.
