# IDE selection

Development for this project often needs to be done as close to the hardware as possible. Code changes typically require testing and validation on actual target hardware.

You can use whatever you are comfortable and productive in.

That might be [nano](https://www.nano-editor.org/), [vim](https://www.vim.org/), [neovim](https://neovim.io/), [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/), or something else entirely.

Note: nano, vi (mapped to vim), and vim are included on the WLAN Pi itself, making them useful for quick edits directly on the target device.

## Visual Studio Code

Need the choice made for you?

Try [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the official [Python extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python). VS Code's [Remote - SSH extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh) is particularly useful for developing directly on the WLAN Pi.

## Terminal Workflow

For those who prefer working entirely from the terminal, one effective setup used by a core developer is [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) + [neovim](https://neovim.io/) + [opencode](https://opencode.ai/).
