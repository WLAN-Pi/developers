# Maintainers

In order to use our Git repositories, you will need
an GitHub account and this is very much encouraged. It is encouraged to understand the [basics of Git](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-the-basics-of-git-in-under-10-minutes-da548267cc91/). If possible, you are also encouraged to join our Slack. Reach out to an existing team member for access.
